Time Invested:
I worked in different chunks of time. Total time invested is around 8 hours.

Time Distribution:
1. Creating word store from json file: 1 hour
2. Implemeting Game Mechanics: 2.5 hour
3. Implementing ViewModel layer: 2 hours
4. Implementing ViewController: 3 hours

Decisions:
1. used Timer to make translation fall from top of screen
2. correct/matching translation presented with probability of 2, i.e. after every two wrong translations, 3rd one will be matching one
2. each right answer will increase score by 1
3. each wrong/missed will decrease lifeline by 1 (max 5 lifelines)
4. countdown timer indicates remaining time for giving an answer


First Thing to Improve:
User experience of the game including countdown timer, right/wrong answer feedback
